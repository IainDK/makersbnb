## MakersBnB

MakersBnB is a group project that was built during my 5th week at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/career-support/). It is designed to replicate a simplified version of AirBnB.

## Technology Used

This project uses Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL, RSpec, Capybara, HTML, CSS and BootStrap.

## Functionality & Features

Users can sign-up and sign-in.

Once signed-in, users will be redirected to the home screen, where they can view available spaces (or list their own).

Users are able to add their own space for rent.

Once a space has been added, it can then be edited to update particular fields, e.g. availability, price and name.

Once a space has been listed, users can view it to find out more information. They can then request to book it should they wish to do so.

After the user has selected their desired check-in and check-out date, they will then be redirected to a new page informing them of the finalised details, including the total cost.

Lastly, users can make the payment via Swipe.
